dark-data
=========

A companion web app for playing Dark Heresy. Filter and highlight skills, talents and traits categorised by the contexts in which they might come in handy.

Curious about how this looks in action? Check out the [demo page].

For the front end interface I used [Metafizzy's Isotope] for the layout framework and [JSON2HTML] to convert JSON objects into HTML.
